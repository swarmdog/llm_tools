# Template Applications [Â¶](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/template_applications/\#template-applications "Permanent link")

Templates are open source reference applications designed to help you get started quickly when building with LangGraph. They provide working examples of common agentic workflows that can be customized to your needs.

You can create an application from a template using the LangGraph CLI.

Requirements

- Python >= 3.11
- [LangGraph CLI](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/cloud/reference/cli/): Requires langchain-cli\[inmem\] >= 0.1.58

## Install the LangGraph CLI [Â¶](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/template_applications/\#install-the-langgraph-cli "Permanent link")

```md-code__content
pip install "langgraph-cli[inmem]" --upgrade

```

## ðŸŒ± Create a LangGraph App [Â¶](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/template_applications/\#create-a-langgraph-app "Permanent link")

To create a new app from a template, use the `langgraph new` command.

```md-code__content
langgraph new

```

## Next Steps [Â¶](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/template_applications/\#next-steps "Permanent link")

Review the `README.md` file in the root of your new LangGraph app for more information about the template and how to customize it.

After configuring the app properly and adding your API keys, you can start the app using the LangGraph CLI:

```md-code__content
langgraph dev

```
