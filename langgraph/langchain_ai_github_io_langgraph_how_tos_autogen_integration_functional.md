# How to integrate LangGraph (functional API) with AutoGen, CrewAI, and other frameworks [¶](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/how-tos/autogen-integration-functional/\#how-to-integrate-langgraph-functional-api-with-autogen-crewai-and-other-frameworks "Permanent link")

LangGraph is a framework for building agentic and multi-agent applications. LangGraph can be easily integrated with other agent frameworks.

The primary reasons you might want to integrate LangGraph with other agent frameworks:

- create [multi-agent systems](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/multi_agent) where individual agents are built with different frameworks
- leverage LangGraph to add features like [persistence](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/persistence), [streaming](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/streaming), [short and long-term memory](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/memory) and more

The simplest way to integrate agents from other frameworks is by calling those agents inside a LangGraph [node](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/low_level/#nodes):

```md-code__content
import autogen
from langgraph.func import entrypoint, task

autogen_agent = autogen.AssistantAgent(name="assistant", ...)
user_proxy = autogen.UserProxyAgent(name="user_proxy", ...)

@task
def call_autogen_agent(messages):
    response = user_proxy.initiate_chat(
        autogen_agent,
        message=messages[-1],
        ...
    )
    ...

@entrypoint()
def workflow(messages):
    response = call_autogen_agent(messages).result()
    return response

workflow.invoke(
    [\
        {\
            "role": "user",\
            "content": "Find numbers between 10 and 30 in fibonacci sequence",\
        }\
    ]
)

```

In this guide we show how to build a LangGraph chatbot that integrates with AutoGen, but you can follow the same approach with other frameworks.

## Setup [¶](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/how-tos/autogen-integration-functional/\#setup "Permanent link")

```md-code__content
%pip install autogen langgraph

```

```md-code__content
import getpass
import os

def _set_env(var: str):
    if not os.environ.get(var):
        os.environ[var] = getpass.getpass(f"{var}: ")

_set_env("OPENAI_API_KEY")

```

```md-code__content
OPENAI_API_KEY:  ········

```

## Define AutoGen agent [¶](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/how-tos/autogen-integration-functional/\#define-autogen-agent "Permanent link")

Here we define our AutoGen agent. Adapted from official tutorial [here](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/blob/0.2/notebook/agentchat_web_info.ipynb).

```md-code__content
import autogen
import os

config_list = [{"model": "gpt-4o", "api_key": os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"]}]

llm_config = {
    "timeout": 600,
    "cache_seed": 42,
    "config_list": config_list,
    "temperature": 0,
}

autogen_agent = autogen.AssistantAgent(
    name="assistant",
    llm_config=llm_config,
)

user_proxy = autogen.UserProxyAgent(
    name="user_proxy",
    human_input_mode="NEVER",
    max_consecutive_auto_reply=10,
    is_termination_msg=lambda x: x.get("content", "").rstrip().endswith("TERMINATE"),
    code_execution_config={
        "work_dir": "web",
        "use_docker": False,
    },  # Please set use_docker=True if docker is available to run the generated code. Using docker is safer than running the generated code directly.
    llm_config=llm_config,
    system_message="Reply TERMINATE if the task has been solved at full satisfaction. Otherwise, reply CONTINUE, or the reason why the task is not solved yet.",
)

```

## Create the workflow [¶](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/how-tos/autogen-integration-functional/\#create-the-workflow "Permanent link")

We will now create a LangGraph chatbot graph that calls AutoGen agent.

```md-code__content
from langchain_core.messages import convert_to_openai_messages, BaseMessage
from langgraph.func import entrypoint, task
from langgraph.graph import add_messages
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver

@task
def call_autogen_agent(messages: list[BaseMessage]):
    # convert to openai-style messages
    messages = convert_to_openai_messages(messages)
    response = user_proxy.initiate_chat(
        autogen_agent,
        message=messages[-1],
        # pass previous message history as context
        carryover=messages[:-1],
    )
    # get the final response from the agent
    content = response.chat_history[-1]["content"]
    return {"role": "assistant", "content": content}

# add short-term memory for storing conversation history
checkpointer = MemorySaver()

@entrypoint(checkpointer=checkpointer)
def workflow(messages: list[BaseMessage], previous: list[BaseMessage]):
    messages = add_messages(previous or [], messages)
    response = call_autogen_agent(messages).result()
    return entrypoint.final(value=response, save=add_messages(messages, response))

```

## Run the graph [¶](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/how-tos/autogen-integration-functional/\#run-the-graph "Permanent link")

We can now run the graph.

```md-code__content
# pass the thread ID to persist agent outputs for future interactions
config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "1"}}

for chunk in workflow.stream(
    [\
        {\
            "role": "user",\
            "content": "Find numbers between 10 and 30 in fibonacci sequence",\
        }\
    ],
    config,
):
    print(chunk)

```

```md-code__content

[33massistant[0m (to user_proxy):\
\
To find numbers between 10 and 30 in the Fibonacci sequence, we can generate the Fibonacci sequence and check which numbers fall within this range. Here's a plan:\
\
1. Generate Fibonacci numbers starting from 0.\
2. Continue generating until the numbers exceed 30.\
3. Collect and print the numbers that are between 10 and 30.\
\
Let's implement this in Python:\
\
\`\`\`python\
# filename: fibonacci_range.py\
\
def fibonacci_sequence():\
    a, b = 0, 1\
    while a <= 30:\
        if 10 <= a <= 30:\
            print(a)\
        a, b = b, a + b\
\
fibonacci_sequence()\
\`\`\`\
\
This script will print the Fibonacci numbers between 10 and 30. Please execute the code to see the result.\

The Fibonacci numbers between 10 and 30 are 13 and 21.\
\
These numbers are part of the Fibonacci sequence, which is generated by adding the two preceding numbers to get the next number, starting from 0 and 1.\
\
The sequence goes: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...\
\
As you can see, 13 and 21 are the only numbers in this sequence that fall between 10 and 30.\

\
```\
\
Since we're leveraging LangGraph's [persistence](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/persistence/) features we can now continue the conversation using the same thread ID -- LangGraph will automatically pass previous history to the AutoGen agent:\
\
```md-code__content\

    [\
        {\
            "role": "user",\
            "content": "Multiply the last number by 3",\
        }\
    ],\
    config,\

    print(chunk)\
\
```\
