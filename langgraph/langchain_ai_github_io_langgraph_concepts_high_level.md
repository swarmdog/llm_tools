# Why LangGraph? [¶](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/high_level/\#why-langgraph "Permanent link")

## LLM applications [¶](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/high_level/\#llm-applications "Permanent link")

LLMs make it possible to embed intelligence into a new class of applications. There are many patterns for building applications that use LLMs. [Workflows](https://www.anthropic.com/research/building-effective-agents) have scaffolding of predefined code paths around LLM calls. LLMs can direct the control flow through these predefined code paths, which some consider to be an " [agentic system](https://www.anthropic.com/research/building-effective-agents)". In other cases, it's possible to remove this scaffolding, creating autonomous agents that can [plan](https://huyenchip.com/2025/01/07/agents.html), take actions via [tool calls](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/tool_calling/), and directly respond [to the feedback from their own actions](https://research.google/blog/react-synergizing-reasoning-and-acting-in-language-models/) with further actions.

## What LangGraph provides [¶](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/high_level/\#what-langgraph-provides "Permanent link")

LangGraph provides low-level supporting infrastructure that sits underneath _any_ workflow or agent. It does not abstract prompts or architecture, and provides three central benefits:

### Persistence [¶](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/high_level/\#persistence "Permanent link")

LangGraph has a [persistence layer](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/persistence/), which offers a number of benefits:

- [Memory](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/memory/): LangGraph persists arbitrary aspects of your application's state, supporting memory of conversations and other updates within and across user interactions;
- [Human-in-the-loop](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/human_in_the_loop/): Because state is checkpointed, execution can be interrupted and resumed, allowing for decisions, validation, and corrections via human input.

### Streaming [¶](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/high_level/\#streaming "Permanent link")

LangGraph also provides support for [streaming](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/how-tos/#streaming) workflow / agent state to the user (or developer) over the course of execution. LangGraph supports streaming of both events ( [such as feedback from a tool call](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/how-tos/streaming/#updates)) and [tokens from LLM calls](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/how-tos/streaming-tokens/) embedded in an application.

### Debugging and Deployment [¶](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/high_level/\#debugging-and-deployment "Permanent link")

LangGraph provides an easy onramp for testing, debugging, and deploying applications via [LangGraph Platform](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/langgraph_platform/). This includes [Studio](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/langgraph_studio/), an IDE that enables visualization, interaction, and debugging of workflows or agents. This also includes numerous [options](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/deployment/) for deployment.

Hey.. how do i stream messages in real-time using langgraph and fastapi over to a client side built on react?

Not sure if it works but came across this - [https://github.com/JoshuaC215/agent-service-toolkit/blob/fb513eb09d8ce3be724e86c60e5013a77388f8d1/service/service.py#L132](https://github.com/JoshuaC215/agent-service-toolkit/blob/fb513eb09d8ce3be724e86c60e5013a77388f8d1/service/service.py#L132)

you can use websockets, like this project [here](https://github.com/shiv248/LangGraphPy-x-ReactJS/blob/main/graph.py).

Can do this with SSE. On the FastAPI side use starlette EventSourceResponse. On the React side use @microsoft/fetch-event-source.

Something that I think I missed reading through this that would have been VERY helpful from the onset (assuming I'm thinking about this correctly):

\-\- LangGraph processes 1 message per graph run/cycle. The point of the framework is to manage the next steps that happen beyond each user's message.

\-\- LangGraph's state persists between messages, or between graph cycles. This is the reason for the checkpointer/thread system, to manage & update state between graph runs/cycles. Each graph run/cycle can also update the graph mid-run/cycle.

As simple as it sounds, this was an assumption that I completely missed reading the docs again early on and caused a lot of headache getting started.

I want to take compiled graph, pickle it and send to S3, but it doesn't work
