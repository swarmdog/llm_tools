**HexGen Mechanics Used in the XCOM 2 Adaptation**  

## Dice Pool Skill Checks  
- **Dice Pool (D6)**: Actions and attacks use HexGen’s **dice pool** resolution. Each skill or attack is rated by a number of six-sided dice (e.g. **4D6** means roll four d6). You roll all dice and **sum** the results. This total is compared to a **Target Number (TN)** to determine success. The TN represents task difficulty or a weapon’s handling rating. For example, a standard shot might have TN 10–12 (Normal difficulty) while a long-range sniper shot could be TN 20+ (Hard). If the dice sum **meets or exceeds** the TN, the action succeeds; otherwise it fails.  

- **Difficulty Levels**: HexGen defines difficulty categories with typical TN ranges. For instance, **Mundane** tasks are TN ~5 (trivial), **Easy** TN 5–9, **Normal** TN 10–14 (moderate risk), **Hard** TN 20–24 (expert-level), up to **Legendary** tasks TN 40+. The AI GM assigns a TN based on context, following these guidelines.  

- **Success Margins**: How much the roll succeeds or fails by can have extra effects. Meeting the TN exactly is a basic success. Exceeding the TN by +10 is an **Excellent Success**, and by +20 a **Triumph**. These high-margin successes can trigger critical outcomes (like extra damage or bonus mission effects). Conversely, failing short of the TN by 10 (a **Fumble**) or 20 (an **Epic Fail**!) means a significant failure with potential complications. The AI uses these degrees to narratively scale outcomes (e.g. a Triumph on a hack might grant bonus intel, while an Epic Fail on a stealth check could alert enemies).  

## Training Points & Skills (Character Creation)  
- **Point-Buy System**: Soldiers are created with HexGen’s point-buy system using **Training Points (TP)**. Each skill, background, or upgrade **costs 1 TP**. A new character might start with ~5–6 TP to spend. For example, a rookie could spend 1 TP on a **Background/Class** (e.g. Ranger) and the rest on skills or special abilities. This one-point-per-purchase system is simple to implement in code – e.g. an array of options all costing 1 point.  

- **Skills & Dice Pools**: HexGen doesn’t use traditional attributes (Strength, Intelligence, etc.). Characters are defined by skills which determine their dice pool. By default, every skill starts at **3D6** (untrained baseline). Training a skill (spending TP) increases its dice by +1D6. Certain skills are designated **Primary** (major focus) or **Secondary**, often based on chosen background. For example, the **Ranger** background might grant a starting 4D6 in **Small Arms** and **Martial Arts** (for guns and melee) to reflect close-combat training. A **Sharpshooter** might invest multiple points in **Small Arms** to reach 6D6, representing expert marksmanship.  

- **Tier & Skill Caps**: HexGen limits skill levels by tier of play. At **Tier 1** (rookie level), primary skills cap at **6D6** (secondary at 5D6). Higher tiers raise these caps (Tier 2: 8D6 primary, etc.). This prevents low-tier characters from exceeding realistic limits. The AI ensures soldiers stay within these caps when spending new TP from mission experience.  

- **Progression**: After missions, soldiers gain additional TP instead of traditional levels. The AI can spend TP to improve a skill or purchase a new ability. Every upgrade still costs 1 TP. For example, after a few missions a Ranger might unlock **Run and Gun** by spending 1 TP (granting a once-per-mission dash-and-shoot ability). This mirrors XCOM promotions in a point-buy way. All such advancements obey the one-point cost rule and tier caps.  

## Turn Structure & Actions  
- **Initiative**: Combat is played in rounds with alternating sides. Typically, the XCOM squad acts first as a group, then the enemies, and so on. Within the squad’s turn, soldiers can act in any order. This phase-based initiative (all players then all enemies) is simple to manage: the AI executes all soldier actions, then all enemy actions.  

- **Actions per Turn**: Each unit generally has **2 Actions** per turn (the standard in XCOM). Most common activities – move, shoot, reload, use an item or ability – use 1 action. Some special moves use 2 (e.g. a full **Dash** move covering double distance). HexGen’s rules likewise allow rookie characters two actions in combat. The AI tracks actions for each unit; e.g., a soldier might move (1 action) and then shoot (1 action), or shoot twice, etc. If they Dash (using both actions for movement), they cannot perform any further action that turn.  

- **Movement & Distance**: Battles are fought on a hex grid (HexGen is designed for hex-based maps). Each character has a **Mobility** rating (speed) which dictates how many hexes they can move per action. For example, a soldier with Mobility 6 can move 6 hexes with one action, or ~12 hexes with a Dash (two actions). Terrain can modify movement costs (e.g. climbing a ladder might consume extra hexes). The AI uses simple distance calculations to validate moves. This keeps movement straightforward for automation.  

## Cover & Positioning  
- **Cover**: Using cover is crucial for defense. In this system, cover provides a **dice penalty** to attackers. **Half cover** (low obstacles) imposes **-1D6** on the attacker’s dice pool, and **Full cover** (solid high cover) imposes **-2D6**. (These correspond to roughly +20 and +40 defense in XCOM terms.) In HexGen terms, this is treating the attacker’s shot as an unfavorable condition (normal vs severe hindrance). The AI will reduce the attacker’s dice accordingly. For example, if an alien would normally roll 4D6 to shoot and the target is in full cover, the AI rolls only 2D6.  

- **Flanking**: Flanking negates the target’s cover. If a unit can move to attack from a position where the target’s cover doesn’t apply, the target is treated as exposed. In XCOM, flanked targets are easier to crit; in our HexGen terms, a flanking shot grants the attacker an **Edge** (a bonus die) of +1D6. This represents the tactical advantage of catching a target out of cover. The AI will attempt flanking maneuvers for both soldiers and intelligent enemies, removing cover penalties and adding an edge die when possible.  

## Combat Resolution (Shooting & Damage)  
- **Attack Roll**: To resolve an attack, the attacker makes a skill check with the appropriate combat skill (e.g. Small Arms for rifles, Heavy Weapons for a cannon, Martial Arts for melee). Each weapon has a **Handling** rating, which is the base TN to hit under ideal conditions. For example, a standard assault rifle might have **TN 14** at medium range. The attacker rolls their skill’s dice pool and tries to meet or beat this TN. Any situational modifiers (cover, high ground, shooter moving, etc.) are applied by adding or removing dice *before* the roll. If the final roll total ≥ TN, the attack **hits**; if not, it **misses**.  

- **Critical Hits**: If an attack roll exceeds the TN by a significant margin (often by **+10 or more**), it is a **Critical Hit**. HexGen’s success margin for an exceptional success (Triumph) is TN+20, but this adaptation may treat +10 over TN as a critical threshold for faster gameplay. A critical hit inflicts extra damage (e.g. +50% or an extra damage die). The AI will check the dice outcome and automatically apply critical damage effects.  

- **Damage & Armor**: Weapons deal damage in dice as well. For example, a rifle might deal **2D6** damage, a shotgun **3D6** at close range. When a hit occurs, roll the weapon’s damage dice. Targets may have **Armor** in D6. For instance, basic Kevlar armor might grant **1D6 armor**. On a hit, roll the armor dice and subtract it from the damage; any leftover reduces the target’s **Health**. By default, an unarmored human has ~**20 Health**. If Health drops to 0, the character is incapacitated or killed. This armor mechanism mirrors XCOM’s damage reduction, as armor absorbs damage before health is lost.  

## Special Abilities & Other Actions  
- **Overwatch**: A soldier can spend an action to enter **Overwatch**. This puts them on guard. During the enemy’s next turn, if any visible enemy moves within line of sight, the overwatching soldier gets a free reaction shot at that enemy. The shot is resolved like a normal attack (possibly with a minor accuracy penalty to reflect reacting quickly). Overwatch is useful to cover advances or ambush moving enemies. The AI will mark units on overwatch and check triggers during the opposing turn.  

- **Grenades & Area Effects**: Grenades and other area-of-effect attacks automatically hit everything in their blast radius (no skill roll needed to hit). The soldier simply uses an action to throw the grenade to the target area. Then the AI rolls damage for each target affected (e.g. a frag grenade might deal **3D6** damage to all in a 2-hex radius). Grenades also destroy cover in the area. *(HexGen notes that targets who cannot escape an explosion suffer its full effect.)* The AI will apply damage to all victims and remove any destroyed cover from the map.  

- **Melee Attacks**: Melee attacks (such as a Ranger’s sword slash or an alien melee strike) are resolved with a close-combat skill check. Typically, the attacker’s **Martial Arts** skill roll is opposed by the target’s defense or a set TN. Melee is usually very accurate at close range, so the TN might be lower than for ranged attacks. On a hit, melee weapons deal damage (e.g. a sword might do **4D6** damage). Melee attacks can also crit (if the roll is high enough above the TN). The AI will use melee tactics for units like Chryssalids that excel in close quarters, often allowing them to move and strike in one turn.  

## Examples of Play  
- **Skill Check (Hacking)**: A Specialist attempts to hack a locked door with **TN 15** (a Difficult task). The Specialist has a **Tech skill** of 5D6. They roll 5 dice totaling, say, **17**. Since 17 ≥ 15, the hack succeeds. If they had rolled a 9, it would fail (9 < 15, short by 6). If they rolled a 25, that’s 10 over the TN – an Excellent success, which the AI might interpret as hacking the door **and** disabling an extra security measure due to the large margin.  

- **Shooting & Cover**: A Ranger with **Small Arms 4D6** fires at an Advent trooper behind half cover. The shot’s base TN is 12. Because the target is in half cover, the Ranger gets **-1D6** on the roll, so they roll 3D6. Suppose they roll a total of **11** – a miss (11 < 12). If they roll **14**, it’s a hit. If they roll **23**, that’s well over TN+10, a critical hit that will deal extra damage. If the trooper was in full cover, the Ranger would have had -2D6 (rolling only 2D6 to hit).  

- **Damage & Armor**: In the above attack, assume the Ranger’s rifle deals **2D6** damage on a hit. The Ranger rolls damage dice and gets **7**. The Advent trooper has **1D6 armor**; the AI rolls the trooper’s armor and gets **3**. The armor absorbs 3 points, so the trooper takes **4** damage. If the trooper had 5 Health remaining, they’d now have 1 Health left. If the damage had been higher than the armor roll plus remaining health, the trooper would be downed.  

- **Flanking Maneuver**: A Sharpshooter moves to flank that same trooper, coming around behind full cover. Now the trooper has no cover against the Sharpshooter. The attack uses the Sharpshooter’s **Small Arms 5D6** skill. No cover penalty applies, and the AI might even grant an **Edge +1D6** for the flanking position, making it effectively a **6D6** roll. The chance to hit (TN 12) is high, and any roll ≥ 22 would be a critical. Flanking thus dramatically improves the shot’s success and damage potential.  

- **Overwatch in Action**: An XCOM Specialist ends their turn on Overwatch. During the alien turn, a Sectoid moves from behind a car into the open. This triggers the Specialist’s reaction shot. The Specialist’s **Small Arms 4D6** is rolled against the shot’s TN (say 10, since it’s close range). However, because the Sectoid sprinted (used both actions to move), the shot takes a **-1D6** penalty due to the fast-moving target. The Specialist rolls 3D6. If the result meets the TN, the Sectoid is hit and takes damage normally. Overwatch shots help cover your squad by punishing enemy movement.
