# Favorite your app

Streamlit Community Cloud supports a "favorite" feature that lets you quickly access your apps from your workspace. Favorited apps appear at the top of their workspace with a yellow star ( _star_) beside them. You can favorite and unfavorite apps in any workspace to which you have access as a developer or invited viewer.

#### Note

Favorites are specific to your account. Other members of your workspace cannot see which apps you have favorited.

## Favoriting and unfavoriting your app

You can favorite your app:

- [From your workspace](https://docs.streamlit.io/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud/manage-your-app/favorite-your-app#favorite-your-app-from-your-workspace).
- [From your app](https://docs.streamlit.io/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud/manage-your-app/favorite-your-app#favorite-your-app-from-your-app-toolbar)!

### Favorite your app from your workspace

1. From your workspace at [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io/), hover over your app.

If your app is not yet favorited, a star outline ( _star\_border_) will appear on hover.

2. Click on the star ( _star\_border_/ _star_) next to your app name to toggle its favorited status.


### Favorite your app from your app toolbar

From your app at `<your-custom-subdomain>.streamlit.app`, click the star ( _star\_border_/ _star_) in the upper-right corner to toggle your app's favorited status.
