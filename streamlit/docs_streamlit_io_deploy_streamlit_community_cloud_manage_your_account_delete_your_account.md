# Delete your account

Deleting your Streamlit Community Cloud account is just as easy as creating it. When you delete your account, your information, account, and all your hosted apps are deleted as well.

1. Sign in to Streamlit Community Cloud at [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io/) and access your [Workspace settings](https://docs.streamlit.io/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud/manage-your-account/workspace-settings).
